      <description>I have been trying out bootkube for a while, its considered beta, i really love the concept and how it works.
For those who have not heard about [bootkube][1], its a tool which is used to bootstrap self-hosted clusters. Self-hosted essentially means running kubernetes as a objects on the kubernetes cluster ( I can hear people close their tabs ), its just kubernetes running on kubernetes. You can take a look at this video where Aaron Levy explain what self-hosted is and how you can benefit from it.</description>
